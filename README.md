# Slime Run

Basic Android 2D side scroller to learn more about game and mobile development. 

## Iteration 1

The base version of Slime Run was created by following a basic tutorial by Adam Sinicki that can be found [here](https://www.androidauthority.com/create-a-2d-platformer-for-android-in-unity-693550/). The tutorial goes through the basics of scene creation, object creation, control scripting and touch interaction. The end result is a sprite moving from side to side, by touch input, on a platform. The source code and a built apk is uploaded to the repository. The next steps are to make the application an actual game with an objective and more funcitionality.
